			<h2>Lindy Hop</h2>
			<p>Lindy Hop evolved in the early 1930s. It is a dance of African American origin characterized by a high degree of physical vigor. The name "Lindy Hop" is often attributed to "Shorty" George Snowden during an interaction with a reporter who asked him what kind of dance they were doing. Because Charles Lindbergh had just made his famous solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean, Shorty George is said to have replied, "the Lindy Hop". The Savoy Ballroom in Harlem was the home of the Lindy Hop.</p>

			<h2>Balboa</h2>
			<p>Balboa, also known as "Bal" is an eight-count dance that's done in closed position. The earliest form of the dance (often called "Pure Balboa") evolved in the mostly conservative dance halls of southern California where space was limited and strict codes of conduct were enforced. Pure Balboa is characterized by an upright posture with partners standing chest to chest. Balboa is frequently danced to fast jazz. Bal Swing evolved from Balboa when original Balboa dancers experimented with fancier variations of the dance which forced the chest to chest connection to be broken. In this form of Bal a variety of spins, turns, dips, tricks, and even air steps are introduced.</p>

			<h2>Blues</h2>
			<p>The Blues was a slow dance done by Lindy Hoppers at the Savoy Ballroom to Blues music. It satisfied a Harlem need for a slower, fluid, but highly rhythmic dance with expressive body movements which could not be facilitated by the upright stance of European ballroom dances.</p>

			<h2>Boogie-Woogie</h2>
			<p>Boogie-woogie developed originally in the 1940s, with the rise of boogie woogie music. It is popular today in Europe, and was considered by some to be the European counterpart to East Coast Swing, a 6-count dance standardized for the American ballroom industry. It is danced to rock music of various kinds, blues or boogie woogie music but usually not to jazz. As the dance has developed, it has also taken to 8-count variations and swing outs similar to Lindy Hop, while keeping the original boogie woogie footwork.</p>
